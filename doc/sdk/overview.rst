Overview
========

The purpose of the OpenDXL Bootstrap application is to generate the structure and related files necessary (a project)
for developing a `Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_ (DXL) integration
with Python. Multiple templates are available which control the type of project to generate (a client wrapper, a
persistent application which exposes services, etc.).
